            <p>Let's move straight on to look at properties for styling fonts. In this example, we'll apply some CSS properties to the following HTML sample:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
&lt;h1&gt;Tommy the cat&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I remember it as though it were a meal ago...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter
may have nestled its way into his mighty throat. Many a fat alley rat
had met its demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of
this awesome prowling machine. Truly a wonder of nature this urban
predator — Tommy the cat had many a story to tell. But it was a rare
occasion such as this that he did.&lt;/p&gt;
                </code>
            </pre>
        </section>

        <section id="Color" class="main-section">
            <header>Color</header>
            <p>The color property sets the color of the foreground content of the selected elements, which is usually the text, but can also include a couple of other things, such as an underline or overline placed on text using the text-decoration property.</p>
            <p>color can accept any CSS color unit, for example:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
p {
    color: red;
  }  
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>This will cause the paragraphs to become red, rather than the standard browser default of black.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="Font_families" class="main-section">
            <header>Font families</header>
            <p>To set a different font for your text, you use the font-family property — this allows you to specify a font (or list of fonts) for the browser to apply to the selected elements. The browser will only apply a font if it is available on the machine the website is being accessed on; if not, it will just use a browser default font. A simple example looks like so:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
p {
    font-family: arial;
  }
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>This would make all paragraphs on a page adopt the arial font, which is found on any computer.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="Font_stacks" class="main-section">
            <header>Font stacks</header>
            <p>Since you can't guarantee the availability of the fonts you want to use on your webpages (even a web font could fail for some reason), you can supply a font stack so that the browser has multiple fonts it can choose from. This involves a font-family value consisting of multiple font names separated by commas, e.g.,</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
p {
    font-family: "Trebuchet MS", Verdana, sans-serif;
  }                    
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>In such a case, the browser starts at the beginning of the list and looks to see if that font is available on the machine. If it is, it applies that font to the selected elements. If not, it moves on to the next font, and so on.</p>
            <p>It is a good idea to provide a suitable generic font name at the end of the stack so that if none of the listed fonts are available, the browser can at least provide something approximately suitable. To emphasize this point, paragraphs are given the browser's default serif font if no other option is available — which is usually Times New Roman — this is no good for a sans-serif font!</p>
        </section>

        <section id="Font_size" class="main-section">
            <header>Font size</header>
            <p>In our previous module's CSS values and units article, we reviewed length and size units. Font size (set with the font-size property) can take values measured in most of these units (and others, such as percentages); however, the most common units you'll use to size text are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>px (pixels): The number of pixels high you want the text to be. This is an absolute unit — it results in the same final computed value for the font on the page in pretty much any situation.</li>            
                <li>ems: 1 em is equal to the font size set on the parent element of the current element we are styling (more specifically, the width of a capital letter M contained inside the parent element). This can become tricky to work out if you have a lot of nested elements with different font sizes set, but it is doable, as you'll see below. Why bother? It is quite natural once you get used to it, and you can use em to size everything, not just text. You can have an entire website sized using em, which makes maintenance easy.</li>                
                <li>rems: These work just like em, except that 1 rem is equal to the font size set on the root element of the document (i.e. html), not the parent element. This makes doing the maths to work out your font sizes much easier, although if you want to support really old browsers, you might struggle — rem is not supported in Internet Explorer 8 and below.</li>            
            </ul>
            <p>The font-size of an element is inherited from that element's parent element. This all starts with the root element of the entire document — html — the standard font-size of which is set to 16px across browsers. Any paragraph (or another element that doesn't have a different size set by the browser) inside the root element will have a final size of 16 px. Other elements may have different default sizes. For example, an h1 element has a size of 2 em set by default, so it will have a final size of 32 px.</p>
            <p>Things become more tricky when you start altering the font size of nested elements. For example, if you had an article element in your page, and set its font-size to 1.5 em (which would compute to 24 px final size), and then wanted the paragraphs inside the article elements to have a computed font size of 20 px, what em value would you use?</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
&lt;!-- document base font-size is 16px --&gt;
&lt;article>&gt;&lt;!-- If my font-size is 1.5em --&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My paragraph&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- How do I compute to 20px font-size? --&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>You would need to set its em value to 20/24, or 0.83333333 em. The maths can be complicated, so you need to be careful about how you style things. It is best to use rem where you can to keep things simple, and avoid setting the font-size of container elements where possible.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="Text_alignment" class="main-section">
            <header>Text alignment</header>
            <p>The text-align property is used to control how text is aligned within its containing content box. The available values are listed below. They work in pretty much the same way as they do in a regular word processor application:</p>
            <ul> 
                <li>left: Left-justifies the text.</li>
                <li>right: Right-justifies the text.</li>
                <li>right: Right-justifies the text.</li>
                <li>justify: Makes the text spread out, varying the gaps in between the words so that all lines of text are the same width. You need to use this carefully — it can look terrible, especially when applied to a paragraph with lots of long words in it. If you are going to use this, you should also think about using something else along with it, such as hyphens, to break some of the longer words across lines.</li>            
            </ul>
